Apple Price Forecasting
This repository contains forecasting.py, which combines various code segments for forecasting apple prices across multiple markets (ARIMA, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, LSTM, etc.). It is not designed to run end-to-end as a single script; rather, it serves as a reference or code dump of the techniques used in my work.

How to Use
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/<username>/<repository>.git
cd <repository>
Install Dependencies

bash
Review and Run Manually

Manually copy/paste or selectively run sections from forecasting.py into your own environment (IDE/notebooks) to avoid errors, since the script is not fully optimized as a single executable file.

You can adapt code paths, data loading, and model configurations according to your data and directory structure.
